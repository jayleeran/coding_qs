# coding_qs
Just some practice coding questions I've come across, come up with, or had an LLM come up with.

Intention is just to use for personal development in Ruby, C++, Rust, and Python, but also happy to share.

## Exercises:

- grid_path: given a grid of 0s, 1s, and 2s (0s being open path, 1s being obstacles, and 2s being targets), and a valid (non 1) starting location, find the shortest path to the nearest target (2).
